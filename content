以往听歌主要注重旋律，歌词不是我关注的重点，特别是英文歌，听个节奏听个响。但是最近重开了Apple Music，听黑眼豆豆的哥时，不经意歌词过了一下大脑，顿觉颠覆了以往对这首歌的认知，我原以为这首歌也是唱男男女女的爱情，其实不然。再联系起以前高中得知because of you不是讲爱情而是家暴时，我也没有细细去深究歌词。今天我打算把两首歌的歌词记下，并试着翻译成中文，与君分享。

Where is the love? The Black Eyed Peas  <<Elephunk>>
爱在何方？ 黑眼豆豆

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
妈妈，这个世界怎么了？
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
人们活的好像失去母亲一样
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
我认为全世界都像演戏上瘾一样
Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma
只沉迷于互相伤害
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
是的，我们口口声声在海外反恐
But we still got terrorists here livin'
但是恐怖分子也在我们这
In the USA, the big CIA
在美利坚合众国，鼎鼎大名的CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
歃血帮，跛子帮，还有三K党
But if you only have love for your own race
但如果你只爱自己的种族
Then you only leave space to discriminate
那只会助长歧视
And to discriminate only generates hate
进而产生仇恨
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
仇恨带来愤怒
Madness is what you demonstrate
接着你会做出疯狂的举动
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
而这正是愤怒的演变
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
老铁，你一定要用爱来改变这一切
Take control of your mind and meditate
控制住你自己的思想
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all
让你的灵魂与爱相吸

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
人们互相残杀，死去
Children hurt and you hear 'em cryin'
你听到受伤的孩子的哭泣声
Can you practice what you preach?
你自己宣扬的东西自己能实践吗？
And would you turn the other cheek?
你能甘受惩罚吗
Father, father, father, help us
神啊，请帮帮我们
Send some guidance from above
请给我们一些指引
These people got me, got me questionin'
这些人让我很疑惑

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake (and Fergie)]
Where is the love? (love)
爱在何方？
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
一切都变了
New days are strange, is the world insane?
每一天都很奇怪，世界疯掉了吗？
If love and peace is so strong
如果爱与和平是如此强大
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
那为什么爱好像不属于我们这
Nations droppin' bombs
交战的国家互相投下炸弹
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
孩子们吸入化学毒气
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
年轻的生命在痛苦中死去
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
问一下你自己，爱是不是真的离我们而去了？
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
我问我自己，到底怎么了？
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
这个我们赖以生存的世界，我们一次又一次地将其放弃

Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
人们为了一己私利不断做出错误的决策
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
不互相尊重，背叛亲友
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
战争打响了，但原因却不清不楚
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
真相被各种掩盖
If you never know truth, then you never know love
如果你不了解真相，那你永远不懂爱
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
你们说，爱在何方？
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake (and Fergie)]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: Apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
我感觉整个世界压在我的肩上
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
随着时光逝去，人们变得更加冷漠
Most of us only care about money-makin'
我们中绝大多数人只关心赚钱
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
自私蒙蔽了我们的双眼以致失去方向
Wrong information always shown by the media
媒体总发布些错误的信息
Negative images is the main criteria
负面形象成了主流标准
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
迅速的感染了青年们的思想
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
孩子们都去模仿电影里的情节
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
人们的价值观到底怎么了？
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
公正与平等何在？
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
我们选择传播憎恨而不是爱
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
缺乏理解使得我们分裂
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
这就是有时我抑郁的原因
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
这也是有时我沮丧的原因
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
难怪有时候我很难受
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
我一定要秉持我的信念直到爱被寻回
Now ask yourself…
现在你扪心自问把

[Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

[Outro]
Now sing with me, y'all (one world, one world)
来，和我一起唱
We only got (one world, one world)
我们只有一个世界
That's all we got (one world, one world)
这是我们赖以生存的世界
And something's wrong with it
这个世界发生了一些问题
Something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with the w-w-world
We only got (one world, one world)
我们仅有的世界
That's all we got (one world, one world)
我们赖以生存的世界

再回看整篇歌词，说实话，前面十年这首歌算是白听了。再来看一首 because of you。


Because of you  Kelly Clarkson <<Breakaway>>

[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
我不会再犯和你同样的错误
I will not let myself
我不会再允许我
Cause my heart so much misery
让我心如刀割
I will not break the way you did
我不会重蹈你的覆辙
You fell so hard
你摔的如此之重
I've learned the hard way
我领教到了
To never let it get that far
到了前所未有的地步

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
就因为你
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
我从不远离生活轨道
Because of you
就因为你
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
我学到保护自己以免受伤
Because of you
就因为你
I find it hard to trust
我发现很难信任
Not only me, but everyone around me
除了自己，还有周围所有人
Because of you
就因为你
I am afraid
我很害怕

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

[Outro]
Because of you
Because of you
